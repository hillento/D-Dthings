This is the start of a character creator
This is a personal project used to expand my capabilities with C#.  
Best practices are not necessarily used throughout this project as it was a learning based project.  
The program reads in delimited text files based on Dungeons and Dragons 5e rules. These are used to populate information in the character creator.  
The the project is not in a finished state but will generate a character sheet with all the needed calculations based on rolls, race, class and background.  
Starting equipment still needs to be added.
